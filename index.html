                    <p>The Flipper Zero is a tool for reading and writing radio frequencies 
                        and cool stuff like that. To get one new is $169.00 plus extra boards 
                        and stuff, but getting one used is a good option if you can find one.</p>

                    <p>I'd like to watch Futurama, but it's only available on Hulu. Therefore, I want enough Hulu gift cards for about a month or so, so that I can binge it.</p>

                    <p>Because of the layout of my computer setup, I sit realtively close to my monitor. Either having one with a higher resolution
                        would be nice. My current main monitor is 1920x1080, so something higher than that is preferable.</p>
